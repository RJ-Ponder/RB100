# Exercise 3
# Exception handling is a way of dealing with foreseen errors so that your program doesn't come to a halt. 
# begin, rescue, and end keywords are used. It rescues you from an exception and performs an action such as logging or printing a message, and your program continues on from there.
# It solves the problem of your entire program stopping because of an error/exception, usually from user inputted fields where they could enter anything, for example.
