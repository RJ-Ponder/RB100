#Exercise 7. What's the major difference between an array and hash?

# Arrays contain values that are ordered with an index, starting at 0. (reference by index)
# Hashes aren't normally depeneded on being ordered (though recently they are ordered by input order)
# Hashes store values in key-value pairs. (reference by key)
